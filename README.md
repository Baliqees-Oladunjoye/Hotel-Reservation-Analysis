**Background**
This project explores a hotel revenue dataset spanning across three years (2015, 2016, and 2017). SQL and Power BI were leveraged to uncover valuable insights about revenue & guest seasonality, parking lots...

Data from raw .csv file was ingested into SQL Server Management Studio [SSMS], from which SQL queries were iteratively built upon to obtain the final SQL output which was then imported into SSMS for data analysis & visualization which was done in power bi. Additional data processing was done in PowerBI with PowerQuery M for visualization purposes. Insight concerning Guests, revenue, seasonality, additional parking lots where brought out.

**Final SQL Code Blocks imported into PowerBI**
